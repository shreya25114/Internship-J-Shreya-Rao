# Java User Input Task

This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates **basic user input handling** using the `Scanner` class.  
The program covers integers, floating-point numbers, characters, boolean values, and strings, while performing arithmetic and logical operations.

## Features
- Prompts the user for:
  - Two integers
  - A floating-point number
  - A single character
  - A boolean value (`true/false`)
  - Their name
- Performs:
  - Sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder of integers
  - Multiplication and square of the floating-point number
  - ASCII next/previous character display
  - Boolean negation and truth check
  - Greeting with the userâ€™s name in uppercase

## Sample Output
- Enter the first integer: 10
- Enter the second integer: 20
- Enter a floating-point number: 5.5
- Enter a single character: A
- Enter a boolean value (true/false): true
- Enter your name: John
- Sum of 10 and 20 is: 30
- Difference between 10 and 20 is: -10
- Product of 10 and 20 is: 200
- Quotient of 10 / 20 is: 0 and remainder is: 10
- 5.5 multiplied by 2 is: 11.0
- Square of 5.5 is: 30.25
- The next character after &#39;A&#39; is: B
- The previous character before &#39;A&#39; is: @
