# Smart Task Manager - Full Project (Starter)

This archive contains:
- backend/  (Spring Boot starter app using H2 in-memory DB)
- frontend/ (minimal static frontend stub demonstrating API calls)

Notes:
- JWT, email verification and full Angular frontend are intentionally left as scaffolding points.
- If you'd like, I can expand the frontend into a full Angular 16 app and fully implement JWT authentication and role guards.

How to run backend:
- cd backend
- mvn spring-boot:run

How to run frontend:
- cd frontend
- npm install
- npm start
